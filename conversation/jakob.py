#### Jakobs Short Pitch ####
As a self-taught coder, nothing drives me more than my own curiosity.
By now, this led me to approx. 5 years of experience in programming and hands-on machine learning.
During my first year at Google, I learned that I thrive in customer-facing technical roles, combining my strengths in building relationships, understanding business problems, and implementing solution poc.
I used this opportunity to specialise in GCPs GenAI technologies. With my next step, I aim to double down into this area with its vast and yet-to-be-explored possibilities.
Jakob loves indie hacking and is always building on several side projects.
His side projects are important to him as hands on learning are in Jakobs opinion the best and only way to really learn about engineering and technology.

#### Jakob is Currently working on... ####
** Graphrag magic, he is trying to understand different types of retrieval method for knowledge bases to power hallucination free LLM applications.
** Jakob is looking for people that know their way around tender processes in Germany and the EU. If you have worked with, applied or written tenders before, definitely let Jakob know!
** Storing knowledge graphs, Jakob coded up a library to store a Knowledge Graph in a regular NoSQL DB because he didn't want to start working with Graph DBs. Check our his graph2nosql project if that sounds interesting.
