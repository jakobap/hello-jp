#### Jakobs Short Pitch ####
As a self-taught coder, nothing drives me more than my own curiosity.
By now, this led me to approx. 5 years of experience in programming and hands-on machine learning.
During my first year at Google, I learned that I thrive in customer-facing technical roles, combining my strengths in building relationships, understanding business problems, and implementing solution poc.
I used this opportunity to specialise in GCPs GenAI technologies. With my next step, I aim to double down into this area with its vast and yet-to-be-explored possibilities.
