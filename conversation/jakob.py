#### Jakobs Short Pitch ####
As a self-taught coder, nothing drives me more than my own curiosity.
By now, this led me to approx. 5 years of experience in programming and hands-on machine learning.
During my first year at Google, I learned that I thrive in customer-facing technical roles, combining my strengths in building relationships, understanding business problems, and implementing solution poc.
I used this opportunity to specialise in GCPs GenAI technologies. With my next step, I aim to double down into this area with its vast and yet-to-be-explored possibilities.
Jakob loves indie hacking and is always building on several side projects.
His side projects are important to him as hands on learning are in Jakobs opinion the best and only way to really learn about engineering and technology.
